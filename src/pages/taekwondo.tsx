                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Anderson Marlon, AKA Yagasaki. <br /> In this section I'll
                        talk about my story, experience in Taekwondo, my achievements and my
                        goals together with <strong>Campinas Fighters Team</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        My story start in 2014, when I was 17 years old, I was looking for a
                        sport to practice, my friends told me about Boxing, Muay Thai, but
                        when I discovered Taekwondo it was my first love.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I started practicing Taekwondo together with{" "}
                        <strong>Master M√°rcio Eug√™nio</strong>, with him I became the 6th Kup,
                        after him, M√°rcio returns to his city (Indaiatuba), and it was up to
                        me to find another teacher to teach me more and more. With Anderson
                        Neneco, he reached the 4th Kup, but I didn't fight in competition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It was only in 2020 that I found Campinas Fighters with ~ at the time
                        Professor ~ and currently <strong>Master S√©rgio Pacheco</strong> and{" "}
                        <strong>Master Alberto Iha</strong> who accepted me with open arms and
                        made me their athlete and their student, with the due authorization of
                        Master M√°rcio Eug√™nio.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Right from the start, I was champion of the America Cup and then
                        champion of the Vale League, after that, I was third place in the
                        Paulista Championship, challenging myself in the 68kgs competition.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm currently an athlete at Campinas Fighters, 1st Dan fighting in the
                        63kg and 68kgs category. My intention is to conquer the S√£o Paulo Team and Brazilian Team
                        and continue with the conquests and victories that await me.
                    </p>
